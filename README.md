## About the game

My game is about getting all the collectables before the aliens kill you.

When an alien touches you, you lose 10 health points (Player starts with 30).

When your health is at 0, you lose the game.

To help you stay alive there are health helpers you can run through.
When you run through a health helper it gets relocated and your health goes up 10 points.

When you run through a collectable it gets destroyed and the number of collectables caught goes up.

When you have gotten all collectables, you win the game.

You can also shoot the aliens, when you have shot an alien 3 times it dies.
